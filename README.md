# Flutter book
This app presents appointments, contacts, notes and tasks. The app will allow the user to create, save, view, edit and delete items of each type. For example, bookmarks, or maybe recipes if you're a chef. At the top are tabs that the user can click on to navigate between the four data types.Each tab has two screens to work with: a list screen and an input screen.
Each list screen is slightly different from the others, as the types of objects differ: appointments should be on the calendar, while contacts should display avatars, notes look like cards, and the to-do list allows the user to mark completed items.
